\begin{abstract}
    Most work on interactions for molecular junctions has been performed within the Master equation approach. This approach has the benefit of incorporating vibrational excitations and interactions up to desired order. In this work we focus on the non-equilibrium Green's Function formalism. We incorporate (strong) electronic interactions and derive the many-body Green's function for a generic molecular junction model. The density matrix emerges as a simple equation using the self-energy. We first apply these principles to the case of a Coulomb Island, a much-studied and -discussed nanoscopic device.  Having established both the basics and the Kondo physics of this device, we move on to consider the intrinsic and pronounced Negative Differential Conductance (NDC) effect in a single thiolated arylethynylene molecule with a 9,10-dihydroanthracene. We show that incorporation of strong capacitive interactions greatly improves the agreement between theory and experiment. The new theory has exciting promise for future studies of molecular junctions.

    \section{Introduction}
        A very common issue in the area of molecular electronics is the difficulty of finding quantitative agreement between the theory and the experiments. This makes the design and prediction of functioning electronic devices based on molecules harder.
        
        Part of this issue is due to the difficulty of incorporating all the details of specific molecules in the description of molecular junctions. Many-body techniques, with a single-particle picture are often used to describe these systems \cite{Tsuneda2014}. 
        
        When a molecule is coupled to metallic electrodes and a bias voltage is applied over the molecule, which causes current to flow, then the system does not have a well-defined ground state. For such a system, trying to solve the Schr\"odinger equation directly is unfeasible. Non-equilibrium Green's Functions (NEGF) methods provide a systematic approach to the incorporation of interactions with an infinitely large environment including bias. NEGF are regularly used to calculate current and charge densities in non-equilibrium many-body transport problems \cite{Mattuck1976, Jauho1994, haugjauho, Datta1997}. 
                
        If the transport properties of a system are affected by its vibrational modes, the NEGF equations tend to become unwieldy and computationally expensive, as all many-body interactions on the molecule are taken into account explicitly. Theoretically, this obstacle in calculations is bypassed making use of the master equation (ME) approach \cite{beenakker}, which is a considerable simplification, yet retains the many-body character of the system. However, both approaches, ME and NEGF, struggle with accounting for strong interactions.
        
        In some sense, the NEGF and the ME approaches are opposite. While the starting point of the ME approach is an entire set of many-body states and their transitions, in the NEGF approach, the starting point is a set of single-particle states and a Hamiltonian that describes the interactions between them. Despite the initial difference, it can be shown that ME can be derived from NEGF.
            
        In the present paper, we present a method, where making use of the NEGF approach, we incorporate strong capacitive interactions  in molecular junctions. This method emphasises the many-body character of the system and results in a better agreement between theory and experiments.
        
        In section~\ref{sec:derivation}, we derive and introduce the theory behind our method, and in section~\ref{sec:island}, we illustrate its effectiveness and completeness by means of the Coulomb Island model. In section~\ref{sec:ahmolecule}, we address a novel example in which the theoretical and experimental currents have been found to match qualitatively but not quantitatively: the Negative Differential Conductance (NDC) found in a single thiolated arylethynylene (AH) molecule with a 9,10-dihydroanthracene core in section~\ref{sec:ahmolecule}. Finally, we discuss the future promises in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

    \section{Derivation}\label{sec:derivation}
        Let us start by defining a generalised Anderson model for a central region with energy spectrum $\epsilon_i$ (operators $\hat{d_i}, \hat{d_i}^\dagger$) coupled to leads (operators $\hat{c}_k, \hat{c}_k^\dagger$):
        \begin{align}
            H &= H_1 + H_2 + H_\tau + H_\text{ML} + H', \label{eq:hamiltonian}
        \end{align}
        where
        \begin{align*}
        H_1 &= \sum_i \epsilon_i \hat{d_i}^\dagger \hat{d_i}, \\
        H_2 &= \sum_k E_k \hat{c_k}^\dagger \hat{c_k}, \\
        H_\tau &= \sum_{ij} \tau_{ij} \hat{d}_i^\dagger \hat{d}_j, \\
        H_\text{CL} &= \sum_{ki}\left\{ V_{ki} \hat{c_k}^\dagger \hat{d_i} +  V_{ki}^\dagger \hat{d_i}^\dagger \hat{c_k} \right\},\\
        H' &= \frac{1}{2} \sum_{ij} U_{ij} \hat{d_i}^\dagger \hat{d_i}\hat{d_j}^\dagger \hat{d_j}.
        \end{align*}
        $H_1$ describes the central region, $H_2$ describes the fermion bath, $H_\tau$ describes tunnelling in the central region, $H_\text{CL}$ describes coupling of the central region to the leads and $H'$ describes the interaction between states in the central region. Modelled in this way, the central region can be anything, but in the current discussion it will usually be a molecule.
    
        To find the Green's Function $G(t,t')$ we use the equation-of-motion method. The definition of the (retarded) Green's function is:
       \begin{align*}
        G_{ij}^+(t,t') &= - \frac{\imath}{\hbar} \theta(t-t^\prime) \left\{ \hat{d}_i(t), \hat{d}_j^\dagger(t^\prime) \right\},
        \end{align*} 
        
        so that the full time derivative takes the form:
        \begin{align}
        \imath\hbar \dot{G}_{ij}^+ &= \delta_{ij} \delta(t - t^\prime) + \theta(t-t^\prime) \left\{ \dot{\hat{d}}_i (t), \hat{d}_j^\dagger (t')\right\},
        \label{eq:eomgf} 
        \end{align} where, by substituting $\dot{\hat{d}}_i$ for the expression recovered from its Heisenberg equation of motion (EOM), we find the expression for the Green's Function. To do so, we need the commutators of the different terms with the creation operator $d^\dagger_i$:
        \begin{align*}
            \left[ \hat{d}_i, H_1 \right] &= \epsilon_i \hat{d}_i, \\
            \left[ \hat{d}_i, H_2 \right] &= 0, \\
            \left[ \hat{d}_i, H_\tau \right] &= \sum_j \tau_{ij} \hat{d}_k, \\
            \left[ \hat{d}_i, H_\text{CL} \right] &= \sum_k V_{ki} \hat{c}_k,\\
            \left[ \hat{d}_i, H' \right] &= \sum_l U_{il} \hat{n}_l \hat{d}_i,
        \end{align*}
        where the first four commutators are well known and can be formulated as self-energies using the Dyson equation. The fourth commutator involves an annihilation operator working on the lead. However, it can be recovered as a self-energy by applying the EOM to find the lead-molecule Green's function $G_{kj}$, leading to the lead-molecule coupling self-energy $\Sigma^\pm$.        
        
        The last commutator still involves operators $\hat{n_l}$ and is not clearly a matrix product. By defining the capacitive self-energy: 
        \begin{align*}
        \hat{\Sigma}^C_{il} &= \sum_k U_{lk} \hat{n}_k \delta_{li},
        \end{align*}
        we have an expression that can be written as a matrix product, but still involves operators. This can be remedied by applying the following expansion of operators\red{[citation, BCH/Z or just point to Dyson]}:
        \begin{align}
        \left[ \hat{A}^{-1} - \hat{B}\right]^{-1} &=\hat{A} + \hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{A} + \hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{A}\hat{B}\hat{A} + \ldots,
         \nonumber\\
        &= \hat{A} \sum_n \left(\hat{B}\hat{A}\right)^n\label{eq:expansion}
        \end{align} 
        which allows us to recover a form similar to that found in \citet{haugjauho}, a sum of the contributions of different many-body states. For this, we apply the expansion to equation~\ref{eq:eomgf} which relies explicitly on the capacitive self-energy. The new Green's function will be called the \emph{many-body} Green's function and be denoted by the symbol $\mathscr{G}$:
        \begin{align}
            \mathscr{\hat{G}}^\pm(\epsilon) &= \left[ \epsilon - \epsilon_i - \tau \pm \Sigma - \hat{\Sigma^C}\right]^{-1}, \\
            &= \left[ \left(G^\pm\right)^{-1}- \hat{\Sigma^C}\right]^{-1} ,\nonumber
        \end{align}
        where $G^\pm$ denotes the Green's Function when capacitive interaction is not included. It can be shown that the lesser (greater) many-body Green's function, like the retarded (advanced) Green's function, becomes a summation over the contributions of different many-body states.
        
        
        We will first look at the example of a two-state model, where $\hat{\Sigma}^C = \begin{pmatrix} U_{12}n_2 & 0 \\ 0 & U_{21} n_1\end{pmatrix}=C^1 n_1 + C^2 n_2$. For the first few orders, we find:
        \begin{align*}
            \left(\mathscr{G}^\pm\right)^{(0)} &= (1-n_1)(1-n_2)G + n_1(1-n_2)G + (1-n_1) n_2 G \\&+ n_1 n_2 G,  
        \end{align*}
        \begin{align*}
            \left(\mathscr{G}^\pm\right)^{(1)} &=  n_1(1-n_2)GC^1 G + (1-n_1) n_2 G C^2 G +\\& n_1 n_2 G \left(C^1+C^2\right) G, \\
            \left(\mathscr{G}^\pm\right)^{(2)} &=  n_1(1-n_2)GC^1 GC^1 G + (1-n_1) n_2 G C^2 GC^2 G +\\& n_1 n_2 G \left(C^1+C^2\right) G\left(C^1+C^2\right) G, 
        \end{align*}
        where we clearly see a pattern:
        \begin{align*}
            \left(\mathscr{G}^\pm\right)^{(n)} &= \left[n_1 (1-n_2) \left(G C^1\right)^n + (1-n_1) n_2 \left(GC^2\right)^n\right. \\ & \left. + n_1 n_2 \left(G (C^1 +C^2)\right)^n\right] G \quad \forall n \geq 1,
        \end{align*}
        which can be proven by mathematical induction:
        \begin{align*}
        \left(\mathscr{G}^\pm\right)^{(n+1)} &= \left( G (C^1 n_1 + C^2 n_2\right)^{n+1} G \\
        &= G (C^1 n_1 + C^2 n_2 )\left(\mathscr{G}^\pm\right)^{(n)} \\
        &= \left[ n_1 (1-n_2) G C^1 (GC^1)^n \right. \\ &+ (1-n_1) n_2 G C^2(GC^2)^n \\ &+ n_1 n_2 GC^1 (G (C^1+C^2))^n \\ &\left.+ n_1 n_2 GC^2 (G (C^1+C^2))^n \right] G
        \end{align*}
        
        Gathering terms for the two-state model and applying equation~\ref{eq:expansion}, we find the exact expression:
        \begin{align}\label{eq:mbgf2}
            \mathscr{G}^\pm &= (1-n_1)(1-n_2) G \\ &+ n_1 (1-n_2) \left[ G^{-1} - U_{12}\right]^{-1} \nonumber\\ &+ (1-n_1)n_2 \left[ G^{-1} - U_{21}\right]^{-1} \nonumber\\ &+ n_1 n_2\left[ G^{-1} - U_{21} - U_{12}\right]^{-1} \nonumber,
        \end{align}
        in general, the expression becomes:
        \begin{align}\label{eq:mbgf}
        \mathscr{G}^\pm &= \sum_\kappa \left(\prod_{i\in\kappa} n_i \prod_{j\notin \kappa} (1-n_j) \right) \left[G^{-1} - \sum_{i\in\kappa} \sum_{j\in\Omega} U_{ij}\right]^{-1} \\
        \nonumber &= \sum_\kappa \left(\prod_{i\in\kappa} n_i \prod_{j\in\Omega} (1-n_j) \right) G^{\kappa\pm},
        \end{align}
        where $G^{\kappa\pm}$ is a shorthand and $\Omega$ denotes a complete phase space. Clearly, the expectation value is just $\mathscr{G} = \sum_\kappa \left|C_\kappa\right|^2 G^{\kappa}$. This is the sought-after expansion in the contributions of the different many-body states.
                  
        We still have to consider the problem of determining the expectation values of number operators. First, recall the single-particle state occupation numbers:
        \begin{align*}
            \braket{\hat{n}_i} &= \sum_{\kappa: i\in \kappa} P_{\kappa\kappa},
        \end{align*}
        where the sum is over those many-body states $\ket{\kappa}=\left(\prod_{i\in\kappa}\hat{d}_i^\dagger \right)\ket{0}$ in which the single-particle state $\ket{i} = \hat{d}_i^\dagger \ket{0}$ is occupied. We can represent the vector of occupation numbers by a matrix equation $\braket{\underline{n}} = KP$, where $P=\text{diag}(P_{\kappa\kappa})$ and $K$ is defined by:
        \begin{align}
            K_{i\beta} = \begin{cases} 1 & \quad i\&\beta=i, \\ 0 & \quad\text{otherwise}\end{cases},
        \label{eq:kmatrix}\end{align}
        where $\&$ is the binary \emph{and} operator.
        
        
        We can also find $\braket{n_i}$ via the lesser many-body Green's function:
        \begin{align*}
            \braket{n_i} &= \lim_{t\rightarrow t'} \frac{\hbar}{\imath} \braket{\mathscr{G}^<_{ii}(t-t')}, \\
            &= \sum_\kappa \left|C_\kappa\right|^2 \int \frac{d\epsilon}{2 \pi \imath} G^{\kappa<}, \\
            &= \sum_\kappa \left|C_\kappa\right|^2 \int \frac{d\epsilon}{2 \pi} \left[ \sum_\alpha f_\alpha(\epsilon) G^{\kappa+} \Gamma^\alpha G^{\kappa-}\right]_{ii},
        \end{align*}
        where the final step utilises both the Keldysh equation \cite{diventra} and the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem \cite{haugjauho}. We then define $W$:
        \begin{align}
        \label{eq:wmatrix}
        W_{i\kappa} &= \int \frac{d\epsilon}{2 \pi} \left[ \sum_\alpha f_\alpha(\epsilon) G^{\kappa+} \Gamma^\alpha G^{\kappa-}\right]_{ii}
        \end{align}
         
        It is important to remember that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem specifies the Fermi-Dirac distribution on the \emph{contacts}, thereby introducing finite bias as a relevant parameter for the density-matrix solution. Accordingly, we have found the following equations for $\braket{\underline{n}}$:
        \begin{align}
            \braket{\underline{n}} &= WP = KP\label{eq:selfconsistent},
        \end{align}
        where it cannot be guaranteed that the null-space of $W-K$ is one-dimensional. We must consider the implications of a null-space containing more than one vector. The physical quantity $\braket{\underline{n}}$ is certainly unique. This implies that all vectors in the null-space result in the same value of the physical quantity. As a result, any vector in the null-space suffices to calculate the expectations of number occupation operators. This then immediately results in a unique Green's function which allows us to calculate transport properties of the equation. In the next two sections we will demonstrate its use for the Coulomb Island and the AH molecule.

    \section{The Coulomb Island}\label{sec:island}
        We are now ready to perform the calculations for a Coulomb Island. Following \citet{haugjauho}, we will set $\hat{H}_\tau = 0$. We need to be careful with the incorporation of the leads. In equation~\ref{eq:wmatrix}, the leads are incorporated through the Keldysh equation and, noticeably, the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. This incorporates a temperature-dependency in the lead-molecule interaction and resulting occupation.
        
        For a two-state system (spin up, spin down) we find:
        \begin{align*}
            G^{\lambda<}_{ii}(\epsilon) &= \left(\left|G_{1i}(\epsilon)\right|^2 + \left|G_{i2}(\epsilon)\right|^2 \right)\left(f^L (\epsilon) \gamma^L+f^R (\epsilon) \gamma^R\right),
        \end{align*}
        where we have used that $(G^+)^\dagger=G^-$ and that the coupling is described by a diagonal matrix. Here, $\gamma^\alpha$ denotes the coupling strength to the left (right) contact $\alpha$.
        
        \begin{figure*}[b]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/figure_1.png}
            \caption{\label{fig:numberoperators}Expectation value of occupation number operators $n_1$ and $n_2$.The emergence of a bound state at low temperatures is evident.}
        \end{figure*}
          
        In our calculation, the lead-molecule coupling $\gamma=.010$ eV, the Coulomb repulsion $U=0.300$ eV, the first level is at $0.00$ eV and the second level at $0.030$ eV, following \citet{meir}. This also means that we have applied the wide-band limit (WBL) approach to the lead-molecule coupling \cite{diventra, Datta1997, haugjauho, Mattuck1976, perrinnano}. We can immediately calculate the expectations of the number operators, shown in fig~\ref{fig:numberoperators}. We observe the emergence of a bound state at low temperatures, evident in the exponential growth of $n_i$. These bound states are average number occupations that result in a fractional charge on the island. Considering that we are dealing with the exact calculation of occupation for an Anderson model, it is likely that we are observing evidence of the Kondo effect \cite{josherrereview}. This is typically evident in the conductance $\sigma(T)$, which decreases as a Fermi liquid (polynomial) until reaching a conductance minimum at the Kondo temperature $T_K$, after which it grows logarithmically until saturating because of low-temperature screening effects.
        
        Following \citet{meir}, we look primarily at the conductance $\mathscr{T}(\epsilon)$ versus the chemical potential $\epsilon$. In a non-equilibrium situation, the Fermi energy is rather badly defined; even more so in a mesoscopic region. The Fermi energy is a bulk property of the Fermi liquid model, which does not hold in the extended molecule. As such, we will consider the full conductance spectrum and follow the conductance maximum.
        
        We primarily at the conductance $\mathscr{T}(\epsilon)$ versus the chemical potential $\epsilon$. Following \citet{meir}, we look at the maximum of conductance because the alternative measure, at the Fermi energy, is poorly defined in our region-of-interest, which is both non-equilibrium and mesoscopic. 
        
        Fig~\ref{fig:transplot} displays the differential conductance $T(\epsilon)$. Note the four peaks that are evidence of interaction effects for our two-state model. The differential conductance traces are offset by the temperature for reasons of clarity. A clear transition to zero occupation is evident as the temperature grows.
        
        \begin{figure*}[b]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/figure_3.png}
            \caption{\label{fig:transplot} Differential conductance $T(\epsilon)$, displaying the multiple peaks that are evidence of interaction effects for our two-state model. The differential conductance traces are offset by the temperature for reasons of clarity. A clear transition to zero-occupation is evident as the temperature grows.}
        \end{figure*}
        
        This state is clearly the bound state that is responsible for the Kondo effect. Fig~\ref{fig:conductance} shows the maximum conductance versus temperature, displaying clearly the expected polynomial decrease with temperature, followed by the conductance minimum, logarithmic rise and final screening saturation. It is interesting to note that there are two regions of the logarithmic rise before screening saturation, likely due to the different available levels.
        
        \begin{figure*}[b]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/figure_5.png}
            \caption{\label{fig:conductance} Average of the differential conductance versus temperature. The clear transition from Fermi liquid-like behaviour to logarithmic scaling is evident followed by saturation is evident.}
        \end{figure*}
        
        The maximum conductance plot of fig~\ref{fig:conductance} combined with the fractional charging indicates that the exact solution incorporates Kondo physics, contrary to many perturbation schemes that are often only valid away from the Kondo temperature $T_K$. Our exact solution thus does not suffer from difficulty in the crossover region. It shows excellent agreement with both theory and experiment \cite{Sasaki2000}. 
         
    \section{AH molecule}\label{sec:ahmolecule}
        
        The single thiolated arylethynylene (AH) molecule Negative Differential Conductance (NDC) was explained by a relatively simple two-site model with Stark effect in \citet{perrinnano}. Contrary to the Coulomb Island, there is tunnelling between the two levels. Within the WBL, only the 'left' level is coupled to the left electrode, and the 'right' level is coupled to the right electrode. The full specification of the model is:
        \begin{align*}
            H_\text{AH} &= \begin{pmatrix} \epsilon_0 + \frac{1}{2}\alpha V & -\tau \\-\tau &  \epsilon_0 - \frac{1}{2} \alpha V\end{pmatrix}, \\
            \Gamma^L &= \begin{pmatrix} \gamma & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} ,\\
            \Gamma^R &= \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \gamma \end{pmatrix} ,\\
            H' &= \frac{1}{2} U \hat{n}_L \hat{n}_R + \frac{1}{2} U \hat{n}_R \hat{n}_L.
        \end{align*}
        The model is thus exactly of the class of models discussed above. The transport eigenvalues are $\epsilon_\pm = \epsilon_0 \pm \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\alpha^2 V^2 + 4\tau^2}$, and we can expect peaks in current at $V = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{4\tau^2}{1-\alpha^2}}$, when the transport eigenvalue intersects the symmetrically distributed bias $\pm \frac{V}{2}$. Of course there is a second set of transport eigenvalues at $\epsilon_\pm + U$, which did not feature in the experiment. However, a fractionally charged molecule might experience a Coulomb blockade because of it.
        
        In figure~\ref{fig:perrinmolecule}, we display results for the AH molecule of \citet{perrinnano}. The green line in the top figure is the experimentally measured current from Perrin 's experiments averaged over a number of separation distances. The theoretical current is displayed with the same maximum current as the experiment, but the ratio is reported on top. It clearly reproduces the NDC effect, the location of the peaks and the flatness in between the two peaks. The peaks are also exactly located at the predicted values. The slope of the figure emphasises that fact. The occupancy of the two levels is clearly antisymmetric, as expected from the properties of the system. Additionally, the occupancy shows a peak at the same location before saturating to $\braket{n_{L,R}}\approx0.5$.
    
        Strikingly, the difference in maximum current is within one order of magnitude for the new theory while \citet{perrinnano} reported a ratio of $1.4\cdot10^{4}$. However, the drop-off from peak current predicted by the new theory is significantly steeper than that predicted and measured by \citet{perrinnano}.
         
        This does not need to be a problem. As shown by the expected occupation of the spatially distinct states in figure~\ref{fig:perrinmolecule}, the charge over the junction is distinctly different from that assumed when subtracting the tunnel current from the experimental results as done in by \cite{perrinnano}. The characteristics change at the same moment as current drops off, complicating the expected behaviour of an empty junction.

        \caption{\label{fig:perrinmolecule} Characteristics of the low-temperature DIH molecule. The calculated current shows great improvement in amplitude and correctly reproduces the NDC features. The drop off after reaching peak current  is faster than found in the experiment (see main text). The differential conductance is nicely symmetric and both show peaks at the predicted value $\pm\sqrt{\frac{4\tau^2}{1-\alpha^2}}$. The occupation of the dot is clearly relevant, as it is fractionally charged at all biases. For this simulation, $k_b T=5.17\cdot 10^{-4}$ eV, $\gamma=0.005$ eV, $\alpha=0.55$, $\tau=0.024$ eV and $U=0.35$ eV.}

    \section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
    We have shown that the new theory of incorporating (strong) capacitive interactions in the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism finally resolves the challenge raised by \citet{haugjauho} to continue their treatment of the Coulomb Island at finite bias. They found an appealingly simple expression for the non-equilibrium Green's function in terms of a summation over contribution from charge states. Nevertheless, it does not possess Wick's theorem and therefore lacks Kondo Physics. In fig~\ref{fig:conductance} we show explicitly that the new theory does incorporate Kondo physics because it constitutes an exact solution which incorporates high-order interactions.
    
    We show that the new theory greatly improves the agreement between theory and experiment in fig~\ref{fig:perrinmolecule}, a problem that poses perhaps one of the bigger challenges for such calculations. While there is still some mismatch in the behaviour of the AH molecule after reaching maximum absolute current, we have posited a possible explanation related to the assumptions employed when subtracting background current from the measurement to recover the characteristic current of the AH molecule. 
    
    %Let us also not forget that the Anderson-like model is a toy-model that showed consistency with DFT calculations in \citet{perrinnano}.
    
    Finally, we emphasise that although the calculations shown in this work rely on a toy model of the AH molecule, it is fully consistent with more rigorous DFT calculations \cite{perrinnano}. DFT is one of the most popular methods used nowadays. It consists of an approach where the electronic orbitals are solutions of a Schr\"odinger equation that depends on the electron density. This approach is the result of the work of Hohenberg, Kohn and Sham \cite{Hohenberg1964, kohnsham, nobel1998} and has proven to be a highly competitive method for a wide range of applications including molecular electronics.
    
    In equation~\ref{eq:mbgf} we see the expression $G^{-1} - \sum_{i\in\kappa}\sum_j U_{ij}$ which equals $\epsilon - \epsilon_i - \tau - \Sigma^\pm - \sum_{i\in\kappa}\sum_j U_{ij}$. In the latter we can recognise:
    \begin{align}
    \mu^\lambda_{ij} &= \delta_{ij} \left( \epsilon_i + \sum_{p\in\lambda} U_{ip} \right) \label{eq:result},
    \end{align} 
    where $H^\kappa = \mu^\kappa + \tau$ is recognised as the effective single-particle Hamiltonian of the system in the many-body state $\kappa$. Many DFT calculations can be combined to obtain a good approximation of the full shape of $H^\kappa$, the effective single-particle Hamiltonian of a system in the many-body state $\kappa$. Some molecules, e.g. those in Ref.~\cite{frisenda}, are hard to capture without such treatment, because they cannot be modelled as a toy-model as we have done here for the AH molecule. Combining such DFT calculations with the new theory should lead to improved agreement with experiment. In particular the formalism should be more accurate for excitations, bound states and Coulomb blockades. This is a useful result for molecules that aren't accurately described as a set of weakly coupled moieties.
    
    Indeed, looking at such molecules could result in another smoking gun for the new theory. A combination of interesting device physics relies on Coulomb-blockades, Kondo physics, image-charge effects and other interactions. While electronic interactions can be directly incorporated using the new theory, image-charge effects can, of course, be incorporated into the transport calculations after using DFT methods \cite{Perrin2013, verzijlgil}. Phononic interactions such as vibrational excitations \cite{vibrations} can be incorporated by combining the EOMs of the expectation values to form EOMS of occupation probabilities which result in the Master equation approach \cite{seldenthuisthesis}.
    
    The method presented in this work shows great promise in treating (strong) capacitive interactions in generic molecular junctions and finally brings Kondo physics into the NEGF fold.
